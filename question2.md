How can you establish a connection between two or many different Jenkins jobs (hosted on distinct servers) to pass the parameters / upstream - downstream jobs etc ..( without using Master-Slave connection in a secured way)

we can use plugin like parameterized remote trigger in jenkins. it helps in connecting jobs from another server.we can add configure by adding new domain and use it.
